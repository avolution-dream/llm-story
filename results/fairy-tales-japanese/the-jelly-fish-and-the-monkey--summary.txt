[Story Summary]
The Sea Kingdom is thrown into turmoil when the Dragon Princess falls ill. Rin Jin, the Dragon King, desperate to save his wife, sends the jellyfish, Kurage, to fetch a monkey's liver, believed to be the cure. The clever monkey on Monkey Island deceives Kurage, claiming his liver is stored in a tree. Kurage returns empty-handed, and for his failure, Rin Jin doles out a harsh punishment, stripping Kurage of his bones, an affliction that his descendants still bear, as evident from the boneless jellyfish found on Japan's shores.
