- [Dialogue]: Richardson: "Twelve-month rolling revenues have fallen by three quarters, but annualizing the last quarter, this is closer to nine-tenths. Supply chains remain nearly impossible to navigate as resources are scarcer and, well, sir, there just aren’t any more crops or trees or water. We’ve entirely pulled out of the African, Asian, and South American markets as, well, they don’t exist anymore." Maxwell: "Jesus, I thought we fucking won. What happened?" Richardson: "Yes, sir, we did. We did win." Maxwell: "Well, then find me some fucking markets, or some goddamn growth. Find me something! Forget annualizing, how are our sales this week?" Richardson: "Well, sir, uhm, in the last week, well, we haven’t sold anything." Maxwell: "Jesus. H. Christ! What happened to the world? Where are all the customers?"

Richardson, his posture rigid with the burden of the news he bears, contrasts with the slumped figure of his superior.

The tension between the two men is palpable, as the air itself seems to thicken with the revelation of a world beyond saving.
