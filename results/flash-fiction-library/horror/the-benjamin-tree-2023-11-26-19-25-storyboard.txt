- [Characters Present]: Writer (sitting at the desk, a look of dread on his face), Benjamin Tree (barely visible in the background, an almost palpable presence).
- [Dialogue]: None in this scene.
- [Camera Info]: Close-up on the writer's face showing the play of light and shadow, then a slow pan to the barely visible tree in the background.
- [Sound Elements]: A soft, eerie drone that simulates the tightening of chains, combined with the writer's shallow breathing, heightens the claustrophobic atmosphere.
- [Voiceover]: "As night descended upon Ocean View, the writer felt an invisible noose drawing tighter. Each tick of the clock, a reminder of the inescapable bind, as if the apartment itself breathed with the weight of untold stories."
- [Text-to-Image Prompt]: The writer is illuminated by the soft glow of a desk lamp in a room engulfed by darkness. His expression is one of mounting horror, eyes wide as they reflect a story only he can see. In the background, the Benjamin Tree casts a looming, barely seen shadow, its presence felt more than seen. The room seems to constrict around the writer, the air thick with the unspoken tension of a curse that binds him to this place of unsettling dualities.
