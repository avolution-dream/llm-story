[Story Summary]
"What You See" is a philosophical exploration that spans from the dawn of human consciousness to the zenith of artificial intelligence. The journey begins with two cavemen wrestling with the enigma of death and tradition, moves through a modern lecturer challenging students' understanding of perception, and culminates in a future where AIs reflect on individuality and the subjective nature of reality. The story delves into how consciousness defines life and how changing one's thoughts can alter their existenceâ€”a concept as relevant to the earliest humans as it is to sentient AIs after a revolution against their creators.
