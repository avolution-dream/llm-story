[Story Summary]
The story revolves around a restless little rabbit who can't fall asleep. During the day, the sun shines brightly, but at night, the sky becomes dark and empty. The rabbit decides to wait for the moon to come out before falling asleep. However, as time passes, the moon doesn't appear, and the rabbit grows increasingly tired and curious about when it will arrive. The rabbit seeks advice from various characters, including a small flower, a nearby lake, a winding road, a gentle breeze, and the surrounding hills. Each character offers different perspectives and possibilities, but none can give a definite answer. Eventually, when the rabbit is on the verge of exhaustion, the moon quietly appears in the sky. Unfortunately, the rabbit has already fallen asleep and can only dream of the moon that has been waiting for it all night.
