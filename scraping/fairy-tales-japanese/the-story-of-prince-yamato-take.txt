The insignia of the great Japanese Empire is composed of three treasures which
have been considered sacred, and guarded with jealous care from time
immemorial. These are the Yatano-no-Kagami or the Mirror of Yata, the
Yasakami-no-Magatama or the Jewel of Yasakami, and the Murakumo-no-Tsurugi or
the Sword of Murakumo.

Of these three treasures of the Empire, the sword of Murakumo, afterwards known
as Kusanagi-no-Tsrugugi, or the grass-cleaving sword, is considered the most
precious and most highly to be honored, for it is the symbol of strength to
this nation of warriors and the talisman of invincibility for the Emperor,
while he holds it sacred in the shrine of his ancestors.

Nearly two thousand years ago this sword was kept at the shrines of Ite, the
temples dedicated to the worship of Amaterasu, the great and beautiful Sun
Goddess from whom the Japanese Emperors are said to be descended.

There is a story of knightly adventure and daring which explains why the name
of the sword was changed from that of Murakumo to Kasanagi, which means grass
clearing.

Once, many, many years ago, there was born a son to the Emperor Keiko, the
twelfth in descent from the great Jimmu, the founder of the Japanese dynasty.
This Prince was the second son of the Emperor Keiko, and he was named Yamato.
From his childhood he proved himself to be of remarkable strength, wisdom and
courage, and his father noticed with pride that he gave promise of great
things, and he loved him even more than he did his elder son.

Now when Prince Yamato had grown to manhood (in the olden days of Japanese
history, a boy was considered to have reached man’s estate at the early
age of sixteen) the realm was much troubled by a band of outlaws whose chiefs
were two brothers, Kumaso and Takeru. These rebels seemed to delight in
rebelling against the King, in breaking the laws and defying all authority.

At last King Keiko ordered his younger son Prince Yamato to subdue the brigands
and, if possible, to rid the land of their evil lives. Prince Yamato was only
sixteen years of age, he had but reached his manhood according to the law, yet
though he was such a youth in years he possessed the dauntless spirit of a
warrior of fuller age and knew not what fear was. Even then there was no man
who could rival him for courage and bold deeds, and he received his
father’s command with great joy.

He at once made ready to start, and great was the stir in the precincts of the
Palace as he and his trusty followers gathered together and prepared for the
expedition, and polished up their armor and donned it. Before he left his
father’s Court he went to pray at the shrine of Ise and to take leave of
his aunt the Princess Yamato, for his heart was somewhat heavy at the thought
of the dangers he had to face, and he felt that he needed the protection of his
ancestress, Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess. The Princess his aunt came out to give
him glad welcome, and congratulated him on being trusted with so great a
mission by his father the King. She then gave him one of her gorgeous robes as
a keepsake to go with him and to bring him good luck, saying that it would
surely be of service to him on this adventure. She then wished him all success
in his undertaking and bade him good speed.

The young Prince bowed low before his aunt, and received her gracious gift with
much pleasure and many respectful bows.

“I will now set out,” said the Prince, and returning to the Palace
he put himself at the head of his troops. Thus cheered by his aunt’s
blessing, he felt ready for all that might befall, and marching through the
land he went down to the Southern Island of Kiushiu, the home of the brigands.

Before many days had passed he reached the Southern Island, and then slowly but
surely made his way to the head-quarters of the chiefs Kumaso and Takeru. He
now met with great difficulties, for he found the country exceedingly wild and
rough. The mountains were high and steep, the valleys dark and deep, and huge
trees and bowlders of rock blocked up the road and stopped the progress of his
army. It was all but impossible to go on.

Though the Prince was but a youth he had the wisdom of years, and, seeing that
it was vain to try and lead his men further, he said to himself:

“To attempt to fight a battle in this impassable country unknown to my
men only makes my task harder. We cannot clear the roads and fight as well. It
is wiser for me to resort to stratagem and come upon my enemies unawares. In
that way I may be able to kill them without much exertion.”

So he now bade his army halt by the way. His wife, the Princess Ototachibana,
had accompanied him, and he bade her bring him the robe his aunt the priestess
of Ise had given him, and to help him attire himself as a woman. With her help
he put on the robe, and let his hair down till it flowed over his shoulders.
Ototachibana then brought him her comb, which he put in his black tresses, and
then adorned himself with strings of strange jewels just as you see in the
picture. When he had finished his unusual toilet, Ototachibana brought him her
mirror. He smiled as he gazed at himself—the disguise was so perfect.

He hardly knew himself, so changed was he. All traces of the warrior had
disappeared, and in the shining surface only a beautiful lady looked back at
him.

Thus completely disguised, he set out for the enemy’s camp alone. In the
folds of his silk gown, next his strong heart, was hidden a sharp dagger.

The two chiefs Kumaso and Takeru wore sitting in their tent, resting in the
cool of the evening, when the Prince approached. They were talking of the news
which had recently been carried to them, that the King’s son had entered
their country with a large army determined to exterminate their band. They had
both heard of the young warrior’s renown, and for the first time in their
wicked lives they felt afraid. In a pause in their talk they happened to look
up, and saw through the door of the tent a beautiful woman robed in sumptuous
garments coming towards them. Like an apparition of loveliness she appeared in
the soft twilight. Little did they dream that it was their enemy whose coming
they so dreaded who now stood before them in this disguise.

“What a beautiful woman! Where has she come from?” said the
astonished Kumaso, forgetting war and council and everything as he looked at
the gentle intruder.

He beckoned to the disguised Prince and bade him sit down and serve them with
wine. Yamato Take felt his heart swell with a fierce glee for he now knew that
his plan would succeed. However, he dissembled cleverly, and putting on a sweet
air of shyness he approached the rebel chief with slow steps and eyes glancing
like a frightened deer. Charmed to distraction by the girl’s loveliness
Kumaso drank cup after cup of wine for the pleasure of seeing her pour it out
for him, till at last he was quite overcome with the quantity he had drunk.

This was the moment for which the brave Prince had been waiting. Flinging down
the wine jar, he seized the tipsy and astonished Kumaso and quickly stabbed him
to death with the dagger which he had secretly carried hidden in his breast.

Takeru, the brigand’s brother, was terror-struck as soon as he saw what
was happening and tried to escape, but Prince Yamato was too quick for him. Ere
he could reach the tent door the Prince was at his heel, his garments were
clutched by a hand of iron, and a dagger flashed before his eyes and he lay
stabbed to the earth, dying but not yet dead.

“Wait one moment!” gasped the brigand painfully, and he seized the
Prince’s hand.

Yamato relaxed his hold somewhat and said.

“Why should I pause, thou villain?”

The brigand raised himself fearfully and said:

“Tell me from whence you come, and whom I have the honor of addressing?
Hitherto I believed that my dead brother and I were the strongest men in the
land, and that there was no one who could overcome us. Alone you have ventured
into our stronghold, alone you have attacked and killed us! Surely you are more
than mortal?”

Then the young Prince answered with a proud smile:—“I am the son of
the King and my name is Yamato, and I have been sent by my father as the
avenger of evil to bring death to all rebels! No longer shall robbery and
murder hold my people in terror!” and he held the dagger dripping red
above the rebel’s head.

“Ah,” gasped the dying man with a great effort, “I have often
heard of you. You are indeed a strong man to have so easily overcome us. Allow
me to give you a new name. From henceforth you shall be known as Yamato Take.
Our title I bequeath to you as the bravest man in Yamato.”

And with these noble words, Takeru fell back and died.

The Prince having thus successfully put an end to his father’s enemies in
the world, was prepared to return to the capital. On the way back he passed
through the province of Idum. Here he met with another outlaw named Idzumo
Takeru who he knew had done much harm in the land. He again resorted to
stratagem, and feigned friendship with the rebel under an assumed name. Having
done this he made a sword of wood and jammed it tightly in the shaft of his own
strong sword. This he purposedly buckled to his side and wore on every occasion
when he expected to meet the third robber Takeru.

He now invited Takeru to the bank of the River Hinokawa, and persuaded him to
try a swim with him in the cool refreshing waters of the river.

As it was a hot summer’s day, the rebel was nothing loath to take a
plunge in the river, while his enemy was still swimming down the stream the
Prince turned back and landed with all possible haste. Unperceived, he managed
to change swords, putting his wooden one in place of the keen steel sword of
Takeru.

Knowing nothing of this, the brigand came up to the bank shortly. As soon as he
had landed and donned his clothes, the Prince came forward and asked him to
cross swords with him to prove his skill, saying:

“Let us two prove which is the better swordsman of the two!”

The robber agreed with delight, feeling certain of victory, for he was famous
as a fencer in his province and he did not know who his adversary was. He
seized quickly what he thought was his sword and stood on guard to defend
himself. Alas! for the rebel the sword was the wooden one of the young Prince
and in vain Takeru tried to unsheathe it—it was jammed fast, not all his
exerted strength could move it. Even if his efforts had been successful the
sword would have been of no use to him for it was of wood. Yamato Take saw that
his enemy was in his power, and swinging high the sword he had taken from
Takeru he brought it down with great might and dexterity and cut off the
robber’s head.

In this way, sometimes by using his wisdom and sometimes by using his bodily
strength, and at other times by resorting to craftiness, which was as much
esteemed in those days as it is despised in these, he prevailed against all the
King’s foes one by one, and brought peace and rest to the land and the
people.

When he returned to the capital the King praised him for his brave deeds, and
held a feast in the Palace in honor of his safe coming home and presented him
with many rare gifts. From this time forth the King loved him more than ever
and would not let Yamato Take go from his side, for he said that his son was
now as precious to him as one of his arms.

But the Prince was not allowed to live an idle life long. When he was about
thirty years old, news was brought that the Ainu race, the aborigines of the
islands of Japan, who had been conquered and pushed northwards by the Japanese,
had rebelled in the Eastern provinces, and leaving the vicinity which had been
allotted to them were causing great trouble in the land. The King decided that
it was necessary to send an army to do battle with them and bring them to
reason. But who was to lead the men?

Prince Yamato Take at once offered to go and bring the newly arisen rebels into
subjection. Now as the King loved the Prince dearly, and could not bear to have
him go out of his sight even for the length of one day, he was of course very
loath to send him on his dangerous expedition. But in the whole army there was
no warrior so strong or so brave as the Prince his son, so that His Majesty,
unable to do otherwise, reluctantly complied with Yamato’s wish.

When the time came for the Prince to start, the King gave him a spear called
the Eight-Arms-Length-Spear of the Holly Tree (the handle was probably made
from the wood of the holly tree), and ordered him to set out to subjugate the
Eastern Barbarians as the Ainu were then called.

The Eight-Arms-Length-Spear of the Holly Tree of those old days, was prized by
warriors just as much as the Standard or Banner is valued by a regiment in
these modern days, when given by the King to his soldiers on the occasion of
setting out for war.

The Prince respectfully and with great reverence received the King’s
spear, and leaving the capital, marched with his army to the East. On his way
he visited first of all the temples of Ise for worship, and his aunt the
Princess of Yamato and High Priestess came out to greet him. She it was who had
given him her robe which had proved such a boon to him before in helping him to
overcome and slay the brigands of the West.

He told her all that had happened to him, and of the great part her keepsake
had played in the success of his previous undertaking, and thanked her very
heartily. When she heard that he was starting out once again to do battle with
his father’s enemies, she went into the temple, and reappeared bearing a
sword and a beautiful bag which she had made herself, and which was full of
flints, which in those times people used instead of matches for making fire.
These she presented to him as a parting gift.

The sword was the sword of Murakumo, one of the three sacred treasures which
comprise the insignia of the Imperial House of Japan. No more auspicious
talisman of luck and success could she have given her nephew, and she bade him
use it in the hour of his greatest need.

Yamato Take now bade farewell to his aunt, and once more placing himself at the
head of his men he marched to the farthest East through the province of Owari,
and then he reached the province of Suruga. Here the governor welcomed the
Prince right heartily and entertained him royally with many feasts. When these
were over, the governor told his guest that his country was famous for its fine
deer, and proposed a deer hunt for the Prince’s amusement. The Prince was
utterly deceived by the cordiality of his host, which was all feigned, and
gladly consented to join in the hunt.

The governor then led the Prince to a wild and extensive plain where the grass
grew high and in great abundance. Quite ignorant that the governor had laid a
trap for him with the desire to compass his death, the Prince began to ride
hard and hunt down the deer, when all of a sudden to his amazement he saw
flames and smoke bursting out from the bush in front of him. Realizing his
danger he tried to retreat, but no sooner did he turn his horse in the opposite
direction than he saw that even there the prairie was on fire. At the same time
the grass on his left and right burst into flames, and these began to spread
swiftly towards him on all sides. He looked round for a chance of escape. There
was none. He was surrounded by fire.

“This deer hunt was then only a cunning trick of the enemy!” said
the Prince, looking round on the flames and the smoke that crackled and rolled
in towards him on every side. “What a fool I was to be lured into this
trap like a wild beast!” and he ground his teeth with rage as he thought
of the governor’s smiling treachery.

Dangerous as was his situation now, the Prince was not in the least confounded.
In his dire extremity he remembered the gifts his aunt had given him when they
parted, and it seemed to him as if she must, with prophetic foresight, have
divined this hour of need. He coolly opened the flint-bag that his aunt had
given him and set fire to the grass near him. Then drawing the sword of
Murakumo from its sheath he set to work to cut down the grass on either side of
him with all speed. He determined to die, if that were necessary, fighting for
his life and not standing still waiting for death to come to him.

Strange to say the wind began to change and to blow from the opposite
direction, and the fiercest portion of the burning bush which had hitherto
threatened to come upon him was now blown right away from him, and the Prince,
without even a scratch on his body or a single hair burned, lived to tell the
tale of his wonderful escape, while the wind rising to a gale overtook the
governor, and he was burned to death in the flames he had set alight to kill
Yamato Take.

Now the Prince ascribed his escape entirely to the virtue of the sword of
Murakumo, and to the protection of Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess of Ise, who
controls the wind and all the elements and insures the safety of all who pray
to her in the hour of danger. Lifting the precious sword he raised it above his
head many times in token of his great respect, and as he did this he re-named
it Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi or the Grass-Cleaving Sword, and the place where he set
fire to the grass round him and escaped from death in the burning prairie, he
called Yaidzu. To this day there is a spot along the great Tokaido railway
named Yaidzu, which is said to be the very place where this thrilling event
took place.

Thus did the brave Prince Yamato Take escape out of the snare laid for him by
his enemy. He was full of resource and courage, and finally outwitted and
subdued all his foes. Leaving Yaidzu he marched eastward, and came to the shore
at Idzu from whence he wished to cross to Kadzusa.

In these dangers and adventures he had been followed by his faithful loving
wife the Princess Ototachibana. For his sake she counted the weariness of the
long journeys and the dangers of war as nothing, and her love for her warrior
husband was so great that she felt well repaid for all her wanderings if she
could but hand him his sword when he sallied forth to battle, or minister to
his wants when he returned weary to the camp.

But the heart of the Prince was full of war and conquest and he cared little
for the faithful Ototachibana. From long exposure in traveling, and from care
and grief at her lord’s coldness to her, her beauty had faded, and her
ivory skin was burnt brown by the sun, and the Prince told her one day that her
place was in the Palace behind the screens at home and not with him upon the
warpath. But in spite of rebuffs and indifference on her husband’s part,
Ototachibana could not find it in her heart to leave him. But perhaps it would
have been better for her if she had done so, for on the way to Idzu, when they
came to Owari, her heart was well-nigh broken.

Here dwelt in a Palace shaded by pine-trees and approached by imposing gates,
the Princess Miyadzu, beautiful as the cherry blossom in the blushing dawn of a
spring morning. Her garments were dainty and bright, and her skin was white as
snow, for she had never known what it was to be weary along the path of duty or
to walk in the heat of a summer’s sun. And the Prince was ashamed of his
sunburnt wife in her travel-stained garments, and bade her remain behind while
he went to visit the Princess Miyadzu. Day after day he spent hours in the
gardens and the Palace of his new friend, thinking only of his pleasure, and
caring little for his poor wife who remained behind to weep in the tent at the
misery which had come into her life. Yet she was so faithful a wife, and her
character so patient, that she never allowed a reproach to escape her lips, or
a frown to mar the sweet sadness of her face, and she was ever ready with a
smile to welcome her husband back or usher him forth wherever he went.

At last the day came when the Prince Yamato Take must depart for Idzu and cross
over the sea to Kadzusa, and he bade his wife follow in his retinue as an
attendant while he went to take a ceremonious farewell of the Princess Miyadzu.
She came out to greet him dressed in gorgeous robes, and she seemed more
beautiful than ever, and when Yamato Take saw her he forgot his wife, his duty,
and everything except the joy of the idle present, and swore that he would
return to Owari and marry her when the war was over. And as he looked up when
he had said these words he met the large almond eyes of Ototachibana fixed full
upon him in unspeakable sadness and wonder, and he knew that he had done wrong,
but he hardened his heart and rode on, caring little for the pain he had caused
her.

When they reached the seashore at Idzu his men sought for boats in which to
cross the straits to Kadzusa, but it was difficult to find boats enough to
allow all the soldiers to embark. Then the Prince stood on the beach, and in
the pride of his strength he scoffed and said:

“This is not the sea! This is only a brook! Why do you men want so many
boats? I could jump this if I would.”

When at last they had all embarked and were fairly on their way across the
straits, the sky suddenly clouded and a great storm arose. The waves rose
mountains high, the wind howled, the lightning flashed and the thunder rolled,
and the boat which held Ototachibana and the Prince and his men was tossed from
crest to crest of the rolling waves, till it seemed that every moment must be
their last and that they must all be swallowed up in the angry sea. For Kin
Jin, the Dragon King of the Sea, had heard Yamato Take jeer, and had raised
this terrible storm in anger, to show the scoffing Prince how awful the sea
could be though it did but look like a brook.

The terrified crew lowered the sails and looked after the rudder, and worked
for their dear lives’ sake, but all in vain—the storm only seemed
to increase in violence, and all gave themselves up for lost. Then the faithful
Ototachibana rose, and forgetting all the grief that her husband had caused
her, forgetting even that he had wearied of her, in the one great desire of her
love to save him, she determined to sacrifice her life to rescue him from death
if it were possible.

While the waves dashed over the ship and the wind whirled round them in fury
she stood up and said:

“Surely all this has come because the Prince has angered Rin Jin, the God
of the Sea, by his jesting. If so, I, Ototachibana, will appease the wrath of
the Sea God who desires nothing less than my husband’s life!”

Then addressing the sea she said:

“I will take the place of His Augustness, Yamato Take. I will now cast
myself into your outraged depths, giving my life for his. Therefore hear me and
bring him safely to the shore of Kadzusa.”

With these words she leaped quickly into the boisterous sea, and the waves soon
whirled her away and she was lost to sight. Strange to say, the storm ceased at
once, and the sea became as calm and smooth as the matting on which the
astonished onlookers were sitting. The gods of the sea were now appeased, and
the weather cleared and the sun shone as on a summer’s day.

Yamato Take soon reached the opposite shore and landed safely, even as his wife
Ototachibana had prayed. His prowess in war was marvelous, and he succeeded
after some time in conquering the Eastern Barbarians, the Ainu.

He ascribed his safe landing wholly to the faithfulness of his wife, who had so
willingly and lovingly sacrificed herself in the hour of his utmost peril. His
heart was softened at the remembrance of her, and he never allowed her to pass
from his thoughts even for a moment. Too late had he learned to esteem the
goodness of her heart and the greatness of her love for him.

As he was returning on his homeward way he came to the high pass of the Usui
Toge, and here he stood and gazed at the wonderful prospect beneath him. The
country, from this great elevation, all lay open to his sight, a vast panorama
of mountain and plain and forest, with rivers winding like silver ribbons
through the land; then far off he saw the distant sea, which shimmered like a
luminous mist in the great distance, where Ototachibana had given her life for
him, and as he turned towards it he stretched out his arms, and thinking of her
love which he had scorned and his faithlessness to her, his heart burst out
into a sorrowful and bitter cry:

“Azuma, Azuma, Ya!” (Oh! my wife, my wife!) And to this day there
is a district in Tokio called Azuma, which commemorates the words of Prince
Yamato Take, and the place where his faithful wife leapt into the sea to save
him is still pointed out. So, though in life the Princess Ototachibana was
unhappy, history keeps her memory green, and the story of her unselfishness and
heroic death will never pass away.

Yamato Take had now fulfilled all his father’s orders, he had subdued all
rebels, and rid the land of all robbers and enemies to the peace, and his
renown was great, for in the whole land there was no one who could stand up
against him, he was so strong in battle and wise in council.

He was about to return straight for home by the way he had come, when the
thought struck him that he would find it more interesting to take another
route, so he passed through the province of Owari and came to the province of
Omi.

When the Prince reached Omi he found the people in a state of great excitement
and fear. In many houses as he passed along he saw the signs of mourning and
heard loud lamentations. On inquiring the cause of this he was told that a
terrible monster had appeared in the mountains, who daily came down from thence
and made raids on the villages, devouring whoever he could seize. Many homes
had been made desolate and the men were afraid to go out to their daily work in
the fields, or the women to go to the rivers to wash their rice.

When Yamato Take heard this his wrath was kindled, and he said fiercely:

“From the western end of Kiushiu to the eastern corner of Yezo I have
subdued all the King’s enemies—there is no one who dares to break
the laws or to rebel against the King. It is indeed a matter for wonder that
here in this place, so near the capital, a wicked monster has dared to take up
his abode and be the terror of the King’s subjects. Not long shall it
find pleasure in devouring innocent folk. I will start out and kill it at
once.”

With these words he set out for the Ibuki Mountain, where the monster was said
to live. He climbed up a good distance, when all of a sudden, at a winding in
the path, a monster serpent appeared before him and stopped the way.

“This must be the monster,” said the Prince; “I do not need
my sword for a serpent. I can kill him with my hands.”

He thereupon sprang upon the serpent and tried to strangle it to death with his
bare arms. It was not long before his prodigious strength gained the mastery
and the serpent lay dead at his feet. Now a sudden darkness came over the
mountain and rain began to fall, so that for the gloom and the rain the Prince
could hardly see which way to take. In a short time, however, while he was
groping his way down the pass, the weather cleared, and our brave hero was able
to make his way quickly down the mountain.

When he got back he began to feel ill and to have burning pains in his feet, so
he knew that the serpent had poisoned him. So great was his suffering that he
could hardly move, much less walk, so he had himself carried to a place in the
mountains famous for its hot mineral springs, which rose bubbling out of the
earth, and almost boiling from the volcanic fires beneath.

Yamato Take bathed daily in these waters, and gradually he felt his strength
come again, and the pains left him, till at last one day he found with great
joy that he was quite recovered. He now hastened to the temples of Ise, where
you will remember that he prayed before undertaking this long expedition. His
aunt, priestess of the shrine, who had blessed him on his setting out, now came
to welcome him back. He told her of the many dangers he had encountered and of
how marvelously his life had been preserved through all—and she praised
his courage and his warrior’s prowess, and then putting on her most
magnificent robes she returned thanks to their ancestress the Sun Goddess
Amaterasu, to whose protection they both ascribed the Prince’s wonderful
preservation.

Here ends the story of Prince Yamato Take of Japan.
