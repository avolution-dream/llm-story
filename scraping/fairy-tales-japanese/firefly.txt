Now, it was the time when the lights at the train station were being turned on. The lights of the mountain train station, resembling the color of ripe persimmons, looked so nostalgically beautiful from a distance that they could bring tears to one's eyes. On the platform, long freight cars lay still as if asleep, unmoved for an hour.

Leaning against the black fence along the railway, Ichiro had been watching that train for a while. What could be stuffed inside those closed, dark containers? Perhaps, they contained unexpectedly dazzling treasures... just like the boxes from that time.

Ichiro remembered a magic box he had seen at a recent entertainment show. The magician’s box was empty at first, but when opened the second time, it burst forth with beautiful flowers like falling snow, scattering over the audience.

“Wow, brother, it's magic!” his sister, Kayo, had exclaimed, gripping Ichiro's arm with a high-pitched voice. “Ah, what magic, it’s just a trick!” Ichiro had responded, pretending to be grown-up. But Kayo was already mesmerized by the magic. “I want a box like that!” she had murmured, staring with wide eyes.

Kayo went to Tokyo yesterday. She wore a brand-new white dress and boarded the evening train to go live with her aunt in Tokyo.

“Goodbye, brother!” At the ticket gate, Kayo waved her little hand incessantly, jumping around as if she was just going to a neighboring town to play. However, her “goodbye” carried a lonely echo.

“Kayo, take care…” their mother adjusted Kayo’s hat. The villagers also bid her a warm farewell. Only Ichiro stood rigidly, gazing at the large ribbon tied to the back of his sister's white dress.

The bow on the ribbon got farther and farther away until it was absorbed into the passenger car. Then, with a rumble, the train slid away from the station...

Now, Ichiro leaned against the fence by the railway, watching the long freight train slowly leave the station, just like the passenger train from yesterday.

To this day, Ichiro felt like crying. He had slept for a night and only realized at dusk that the fact of his only sister going far away and not returning was true.

Usually, at this time, Ichiro and Kayo would be waiting for their mother. Five-year-old Kayo would be so hungry she'd cry, throwing away the dolls she was holding. Watching his sister suffer every day was unbearable for Ichiro... but the evenings without Kayo were even more unbearable. Sitting alone, hugging his knees in the house as dark as a cave was so unpleasant and lonely... Ah, now, Kayo must be in a dazzling town, eating delicious food and playing with beautiful toys. Suddenly, an immense sadness filled him, and tears welled up in his eyes.

After the long freight train left the station, the afterglow of the sunset was flowing over the platform across. The flowers of the bird-of-paradise planted on the platform were still faintly shining.

At that moment, Ichiro saw something strange in the middle of the platform. It was luggage. A huge, astonishingly large white travel case forgotten by someone? It might be a high-end item, tightly closed, its silver metallic parts shining like stars.

“Whose luggage is it?” Ichiro muttered quietly. Whoever could carry such a large case must be a very strong man. But there was no one like that on the platform. It seemed as if the case had been carelessly left there by the freight train, lying there asleep.

Ichiro blinked hard. At this moment, he saw something unexpected that hadn't caught his eye until now. Sitting on top of the suitcase was a little girl in a white dress, like a bird perched on a large tree, or like a budding flower. The girl, swinging her dangling legs, seemed to be waiting for someone.

Ichiro suddenly felt as if he had encountered Kayo. The girl's hair, the way she swung her dangling legs, the somewhat serious look when dressed in outdoor clothes, all reminded him of Kayo. Memories of the sweet and sour times spent with little Kayo flooded his heart. Humming a song that Kayo sang unclearly, he remembered her small white hands holding snacks, agile and willful like a butterfly...

Nevertheless, who was that girl waiting for? There had been no one on the platform for a long time, and no new train seemed to be arriving. The girl, like a forgotten doll, sat immobile on top of the suitcase.

Ichiro thought: Could she be a child left behind? A mother in difficult circumstances, leaving her with the luggage... No, no, it would be hard for a mother to move such a big suitcase... Perhaps it was a father who couldn't take care of the child and left her here. Inside the suitcase, there might be clothes for the girl to change into, snacks, toys, and a note saying 'Please take care of her.' The father who disappeared, he would never, ever come back... Yes. It was a common story in the newspapers, but such incidents were not likely to happen at a mountain station like this.

It was completely dark around, and the lights of the station seemed brighter than ever. Ichiro felt as if he was watching a bizarre stage in a strange theater. Bathed in the orange-yellow spotlight, the girl might start singing at any moment.

Just as he thought this, the girl gracefully jumped down from the suitcase and swiftly opened it... The suitcase split into two halves with a snap, and what flew out were fireflies. The suitcase was filled with fireflies. Swarms of them flew from the station, across the railway, flickering as they came towards Ichiro. His heart raced. He spread his arms wide and called out, “Fireflies—fireflies—fireflies!”

Ichiro couldn't help but start running. If he went there, he would meet Kayo, he would see Kayo... he thought as he ran.

But no matter how fast he ran, he couldn't catch up with the blue swarm of light.

The fireflies rose higher and higher, and before he knew it, Ichiro was running under a sky full of stars.
