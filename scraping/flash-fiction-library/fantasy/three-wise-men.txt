Title: Three Wise Men



“Dude, are we there yet?”

“No, we not. Chill man, we’ll get there when we get there.”

“But we’ve been travelling all night. Why can’t we just pop into somewhere to overnight? It doesn’t even have to be fancy, just somewhere to get some damn shut-eye.”

“Fine! Fine. Fine… There isn’t a huge amount around, so how do you guys feel about crashing in that farm-looking building? It’s probably a barn or stable or something, so we can sleep on the hay or something?”

“Uh, yeah, dude, I could do that.”

“Yep, me too.”

“OK, but I see a light on in there? Well, it looks like a big stable, so I’m sure there will be place to for us as well. Just in case, guys, ready some of our gold and trade spices. If there are people in that stable then I am going to have to wing it and see if we can convince them to let us sleep there…”

“Sure thing, dude, we’re right behind–wait! If they ask where we are from, what do we say?”

“You just let me do the talking, OK? A little flattery and a little vagueness goes a long way. Besides, this part of the land is quite religious, so I’ll just pepper some of that into our tale.”

“OK, man, sounds good. Let’s do this, I’m exhausted.”
