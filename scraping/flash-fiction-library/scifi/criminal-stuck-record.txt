“Well, I didn’t because I thoughtyoudid.”

“Well, I didn’t either, so we’re fucked.”

“Fuck!”

“It’s no use now. Seriously, what are we going to do? We only had this single window to slip in here before they moved the prototype.”

“Well, why don’t we justpressit and find out?”

“Um…”

“Come on, let’s press it. It can’t make things worse? It just resets our timeline by a couple of minutes. We should be outside back then. You can then hopefully remember to bring the right tools to steal it and we won’t be here wasting our time then.”

“Ah… Sure, um, ok, I suppose that makes sense. Can’t be much harm in doing that.”

“Good, then–”

“Wait! Just want to run through it again before you press it…”

“OK.”

“When you activate the time travel device, we pop back some thirty minutes to when we were en route to this facility.Youpop off to get the correct anti-gravity mobile chamber that we can carry this fragile thing in. Then when we reach the facility and we can successfully rob it? Right?”

“Yes.”

“OK… Hit it!”
