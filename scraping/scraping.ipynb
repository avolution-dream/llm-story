Then he breathed upon\\nthem, and at once the mother was alive again. This made the son very\\nhappy, and he thanked the priest on his knees. Yet on a sharp point of\\nrock he still saw a bit of his mother\\'s flesh hanging, a bit about an\\ninch long.', 'can wake the\\ndead to life again, and surround white bones with flesh and blood!\"', 'do with it?\"', 'am escorting him.\"', 'have lost my Great Duty because I was too greedy for that\\nSmall Profit!\"', 'will marry him,\\nand then, perhaps, I will share in his good luck.\"', 'will set out and seek my fortune.\\nAnd when I have found it, I will come back again and fetch you.\" The\\nprincess was willing, and he went away, and was gone for eighteen\\nyears. Meanwhile the princess lived in want and affliction, for her\\nfather remained hard and merciless. If her mother had not secretly\\ngiven her food and money, no doubt she would have starved to death\\nduring all that time.', 'am getting along?\" she replied. \"I am too far\\nbeneath your notice.\"', 'have been waiting for him to return.\"', 'will remain his wife until I die.\"', 'came after.\"', 'will wait below here, until you are in\\nsafety.\" At first the king\\'s daughter was not willing; yet at last she\\nallowed herself to be persuaded, and climbed into the basket. But\\nbefore she did so, she took a long pin from her hair, broke it into\\ntwo halves and gave him one and kept the other. She also divided her\\nsilken kerchief with him, and told him to take good care of both her\\ngifts. But when the other man had drawn up the king\\'s daughter, he\\ntook her along with him, and left the youth in the cave, in spite of\\nall his calling and pleading.', 'found pearls in a tortoise-shell, and have flung one into the sea, and\\nnow the waters have divided for me.\"', 'am your\\nfather,\" said the old dragon. And he entertained him hospitably with\\nfood and wine.', 'want no money, nor any jewels. All\\nI want is the little gourd flask over yonder.\"', 'only had a litter! That would suit me better.\" No more\\nhad he thought so, than the litter came along, and he seated himself\\nin it. And the bearers carried him to the city in which dwelt the\\nking, the queen and their daughter.', 'am cooking wild duck eggs. I\\nwill give you one, but you must not let your sisters know.\" And so she\\ngave her one. Then the second daughter woke up, and asked her mother\\nwhat she was cooking. She said: \"Wild duck eggs. If you will not tell\\nyour sisters, I\\'ll give you one.\" And so it went. At last the\\ndaughters had eaten all the eggs, and there were none left.', 'will drive into the village ahead of you, and tell\\ngrandmother that you are coming.\" And then he drove off with the\\ndonkey-cart. They waited and waited, but their father did not come. At\\nlast they decided that their father would not come back to fetch them,\\nand that he had left them alone in the mountains. So they went further\\nand further into the hills seeking a shelter for the night. Then they\\nspied a great stone. This they selected for a pillow, and rolled it\\nover to the place where they were going to lie down to sleep. And then\\nthey saw that the stone was the door to a cave. There was a light in\\nthe cave, and they went into it. The light they had seen came from the\\nmany precious stones and jewels of every sort in the cave, which\\nbelonged to a wolf and a fox. They had a number of jars of precious\\nstones and pearls that shone by night. The girls said: \"What a lovely\\ncave this is! We will lie right down and go to bed.\" For there stood\\ntwo golden beds with gold-embroidered covers. So they lay down and\\nfell asleep. During the night the wolf and fox came home. And the\\nwolf said: \"I smell human flesh!\" But the fox replied: \"Oh, nonsense!\\nThere are no human beings who can enter our cave. We lock it up too\\nwell for that.\" The wolf said: \"Very well, then let us lie down in our\\nbeds and sleep.\" But the fox answered: \"Let us curl up in the kettles\\non the hearth. They still hold a little warmth from the fire.\" The one\\nkettle was of gold and the other of silver, and they curled up in\\nthem.', 'am going to see grandmother, together with your\\nlittle brother!\" So the daughters promised her they would do so, and\\ntheir mother went off. On her way a panther met her, and asked where\\nshe were going.', 'am going with my child to see my mother.\"', 'will comb your hair a bit,\" said the panther. And the woman allowed\\nthe panther to comb her hair. But as he passed his claws through her\\nhair, he tore off a bit of her skin and devoured it.', 'have been to grandmother\\'s house, and saw\\nher hens laying eggs. That pleases me, and is the reason why my eyes\\nhave grown so large.\"', 'had to sleep on the peas, and they\\npressed themselves into my face.\"', 'will not give you any. Now be quiet and go to\\nsleep.\"', 'have none.\\nAnd that makes me feel very sad!\"', 'want for my grandmother!\" And his mother\\nwas willing and called her into the house; though the old woman was\\nvery dirty. So the boy said to his mother: \"Come, let us wash\\ngrandmother!\" And they washed the woman. But she had a great many\\nburrs in her hair, so they picked them all out and put them in a jar,\\nand they filled the whole jar. Then the grandmother said: \"Do not\\nthrow them away, but bury them in the garden. And you must not dig\\nthem up again before the great flood comes.\"', 'feel sorry for him, and cannot bear to see him\\ndrifting along in the water.\" So they also saved the man.', 'wandered\\nabout in the world of men disguised as a beggar woman. And this boy\\nand his mother took me in. The boy treated me like his own\\ngrandmother, and did not shrink from washing me when I was dirty.\\nBecause of this I saved them out of the great flood by means of which\\nI destroyed the sinful city wherein they dwelt.

I\\nthank you!\"', 'get\\nthere?\"', 'will carry you there,\" answered the yellow cow.', 'will give you\\nyour clothes.\"', 'am a daughter of the Ruler of the Gods,\" said she, \"and may not\\nmarry without his command.

Of that I am sure.\"', 'delay too long I fear that he will punish me. Yet, although\\nwe have to part now, we will meet again in spite of it.\"', 'have mentioned. And besides, a fine rain often falls on the\\nevening of the Seventh Day. Then the women and old grandmothers say to\\none another: \"Those are the tears which the Herd Boy and the Weaving\\nMaiden shed at parting!\" And for this reason the Seventh Day is a rain\\nfestival.', 'hills. Her son,\\nhowever, Oerlang by name, the nephew of the Ruler of Heaven, was\\nextraordinarily gifted by nature. By the time he was full grown he had\\nlearned the magic art of being able to control eight times nine\\ntransformations. He could make himself invisible, or could assume the\\nshape of birds and beasts, grasses, flowers, snakes and fishes, as he\\nchose. He also knew how to empty out seas and remove mountains from\\none place to another. So he went to the Wu-I hills and rescued his\\nmother, whom he took on his back and carried away. They stopped to\\nrest on a flat ledge of rock.', 'am very thirsty!\"', '(comp. No. 19). Here,', 'am the Great One. This boy is the bright Pearl of the\\nBeginning of Things, bestowed upon you as your son. Yet the boy is\\nwild and unruly, and will kill many men. Therefore I will take him as\\nmy pupil to gentle his savage ways.\" Li Dsing bowed his thanks and the\\nGreat One disappeared.', 'killed him. What\\ndifference does it make?\" Then the dragon assailed him with his\\nhalberd. But Notscha said: \"Tell me who you are before we fight.\" \"I\\nam the son of the Dragon-King,\" was the reply. \"And I am Notscha, the\\nson of General Li Dsing. You must not rouse my anger with your\\nviolence, or I will skin you, together with that old mud-fish, your\\nfather!\" Then the dragon grew wild with rage, and came storming along\\nfuriously. But Notscha cast his crimson cloth into the air, so that it\\nflashed like a ball of fire, and cast the dragon-youth from his\\nbreast. Then Notscha took his golden armlet and struck him on the\\nforehead with it, so that he had to reveal himself in his true form as\\na golden dragon, and fall down dead.', 'have heard tell that dragon-sinews make\\ngood cords. I will draw one out and bring it to my father, and he can\\ntie his armor together with it.\" And with that he drew out the\\ndragon\\'s back sinew and took it home.', 'will just go to my master, the Great One, and he will know\\nwhat is to be done.\" And no sooner had he said the words than he had\\ndisappeared. He came into his master\\'s presence and told him the whole\\ntale. The latter said: \"You must get ahead of the dragon, and prevent\\nhim from accusing you in Heaven!\" Then he did some magic, and Notscha\\nfound himself set down by the gate of Heaven, where he waited for the\\ndragon. It was still early in the morning; the gate of Heaven had not\\nyet been opened, nor was the watchman at his post. But the dragon was\\nalready climbing up. Notscha, whom his master\\'s magic had rendered\\ninvisible, threw the dragon to the ground with his armlet, and began\\nto pitch into him. The dragon scolded and screamed. \"There the old\\nworm flounders about,\" said Notscha, \"and does not care how hard he is\\nbeaten! I will scratch off some of his scales.\" And with these words\\nhe began to tear open the dragon\\'s festal garments, and rip off some\\nof the scales beneath his left arm, so that the red blood dripped out.\\nThen the dragon could no longer stand the pain and begged for mercy.\\nBut first he had to promise Notscha that he would not complain of\\nhim, before the latter would let him go. And then the dragon had to\\nturn himself into a little green snake, which Notscha put into his\\nsleeve and took back home with him. But no sooner had he drawn the\\nlittle snake from his sleeve than it assumed human shape. The dragon\\nthen swore that he would punish Li Dsing in a terrible manner, and\\ndisappeared in a flash of lightning.', 'will\\ntake the punishment for whatever I have done! My parents are\\nblameless! What is the punishment you wish to lay upon me?\" \"Life for\\nlife!\" said the dragon. \"Very well then, I will destroy myself!\" And\\nso he did and the dragons went off satisfied; while Notscha\\'s mother\\nburied him with many tears.', 'to\\nshoot at them. And Hou I shot nine of them down from the sky. Besides\\nhis bow, Hou I also had a horse which ran so swiftly that even the\\nwind could not catch up with it. He mounted it to go a-hunting, and\\nthe horse ran away and could not be stopped. So Hou I came to Kunlun\\nMountain and met the Queen-Mother of the Jasper Sea. And she gave him\\nthe herb of immortality. He took it home with him and hid it in his\\nroom. But his wife who was named Tschang O, once ate some of it on the\\nsly when he was not at home, and she immediately floated up to the\\nclouds. When she reached the moon, she ran into the castle there, and\\nhas lived there ever since as the Lady of the Moon.', '', \"THE GIRL WITH THE HORSE'S HEAD OR THE SILKWORM GODDESS\", 'will marry you!\"', 'have been assigned to the task of\\nwatching over the growing of silkworms. You must yearn for me no\\nlonger!\" And thereupon they built temples to her in her native land,\\nand every year, at the silkworm season, sacrifices are offered to her\\nand her protection is implored. And the Silkworm Goddess is also known\\nas the girl with the Horse\\'s Head.', 'must tell you the truth. I am the Fire-God. To-morrow a fire\\nwill break out in your house. Hurry home at once to arrange your\\naffairs and save what you can!\" Frightened, the man faced his horses\\nabout and drove home as fast as he could. All that he possessed in the\\nway of treasures, clothes and jewels, he removed from the house. And,\\nwhen he was about to lie down to sleep, a fire broke out on the hearth\\nwhich could not be quenched until the whole building had collapsed in\\ndust and ashes. Yet, thanks to the Fire-God, the man had saved all his\\nmovable belongings.', 'want my\\nhead back again!\"', 'cannot endure its radiance even a thousand miles away, so I\\nmust hurry and get out of the way!\" And with that he stepped into a\\ncloud and disappeared. The Master of the Heavens then told the\\nmandarin what had happened, and added: \"Fortunately you did not see\\nthe God of War face to face! Whoever does not possess the greatest\\nvirtue and the greatest wisdom, would be melted by the red glow of\\nhis halo.\" So saying he gave him a pill of the elixir of life to eat,\\nand his blind eye gradually regained its sight.', 'dread them and do\\nnot dare enter their houses.\"', 'am a scholar, too! Have I no halo which\\nmakes you fear me, instead of going walking with me?\"', 'have never yet seen it surrounded by a halo.\"', 'hired you, and since I was\\npoor and could give you no money, I gave you a life-giving talisman to\\neat. That is how you still happen to be alive. I said to you: \\'If you\\nwill follow me into the West, the land of Blessed Repose, I will pay\\nyou your wages in yellow gold. But you did not wish to do this.\\'\" And\\nwith that he patted his servant\\'s neck. Thereupon the latter opened\\nhis mouth, and spat out the life-giving talisman. The magic signs\\nwritten on it with cinnabar, quite fresh and well-preserved, might\\nstill be seen. But the servant suddenly collapsed and turned into a\\nheap of dry bones. Then the guardian of the pass cast himself to earth\\nand pleaded for him. He promised to pay the servant for Laotsze and\\nbegged the latter to restore him to life. So Laotsze placed the\\ntalisman among the bones and at once the servant came to life again.\\nThe guardian of the pass paid him his wages and dismissed him. Then he\\nadored Laotsze as his master, and the latter taught him the art of\\neternal life, and left him his teachings, in five thousand words,\\nwhich the guardian wrote down. The book which thus came into being is\\nthe Tao Teh King, \"The Book of the Way and Life.\" Laotsze then\\ndisappeared from the eyes of men. The guardian of the pass however,\\nfollowed his teachings, and was given a place among the immortals.', 'have worn its shield quite flat sitting on it.

When I was sixteen I was wedded to the youngest\\nson of the Rock-Dragon. But my good husband had a fiery temper, which\\noften caused him to offend against the laws of courtesy, and in less\\nthan a year\\'s time the punishment of heaven was his portion. I was\\nleft alone and returned to the home of my parents. My father wished me\\nto marry again; but I had promised to remain true to the memory of my\\nhusband, and made a vow not to comply with my father\\'s wish. My\\nparents grew angry, and I was obliged to retire to this place in view\\nof their anger. That was three years ago. Who could imagine that the\\ncontemptible dragon Tschauna, who was seeking a wife for his youngest\\nbrother, would try to force the wedding-gift upon me? I refused to\\naccept it; but Tschauna knew how to gain his point with my father, and\\nwas determined to carry out his intention. My father, regardless of my\\nwishes, promised me to him. And then the dragon Tschauna appeared with\\nhis youngest brother and wanted to carry me off by sheer force of\\narms. I encountered him with fifty faithful followers, and we fought\\non the meadow before the city. We were defeated, and I am more than\\never afraid that Tschauna will attempt to drag me off.

Yesterday the robbers came with three thousand\\nmen, and Mong Yuan was beaten by them. When you return and again see\\nyour master, say that I earnestly beg him to send me a good general.\\nPerhaps that will save me in my need.\\' Then she had me led back again\\nand I regained consciousness.\"', 'saw a man in a purple\\ngown riding a black horse, who came up with a great retinue. He\\ndismounted before the door. In his hand he held a decree of\\nappointment which he gave me, saying: \\'Our princess begs you most\\nrespectfully to become her general. I hope that you will not refuse.\\'\\nThen he brought forth gifts and heaped them up before the steps.\\nJade-stones, brocades, and silken garments, saddles, horses, helmets\\nand suits of mail--he heaped them all up in the courtyard. I wished to\\ndecline, but this he would not allow, and urged me to enter his\\nchariot with him. We drove a hundred miles and met a train of\\nthree-hundred armored horsemen who had ridden out to escort me. They\\nled me to a great city, and before the city a tent had been erected in\\nwhich played a band of musicians. A high official welcomed me. When I\\nentered the city the onlookers were crowded together like walls.\\nServants ran to and fro bearing orders. We passed through more than a\\ndozen gates before we reached the princess. There I was requested to\\ndismount and change my clothes in order to enter the presence of the\\nprincess, for she wished to receive me as her guest. But I thought\\nthis too great an honor and greeted her below, on the steps. She,\\nhowever, invited me to seat myself near her in the hall. She sat\\nupright in all her incomparable beauty, surrounded by female\\nattendants adorned with the richest jewels. These plucked lute-strings\\nand played flutes. A throng of servitors stood about in golden girdles\\nwith purple tassels, ready to carry out her commands. Countless crowds\\nwere assembled before the palace. Five or six visitors sat in a circle\\nabout the princess, and a general led me to my place. The princess\\nsaid to me: \\'I have begged you to come here in order to entrust the\\ncommand of my army to you. If you will break the power of my foe I\\nwill reward you richly.\\' I promised to obey her. Then wine was\\nbrought in, and the banquet was served to the sound of music. While we\\nwere at table a messenger entered: \\'The robber Tschauna has invaded\\nour land with ten thousand footmen and horsemen, and is approaching\\nour city by various roads. His way is marked by columns of fire and\\nsmoke!\\' The guests all grew pale with terror when they heard the news.\\nAnd the princess said: \\'This is the foe because of whom I have sought\\nyour aid. Save me in my hour of need!\\' Then she gave me two chargers,\\na suit of golden armor, and the insignia of a commander-in-chief, and\\nbowed to me. I thanked her and went, called together the captains, had\\nthe army mustered and rode out before the city. At several decisive\\npoints I placed troops in ambush. The enemy was already approaching in\\ngreat force, careless and unconcerned, intoxicated by his former\\nvictories. I sent out my most untrustworthy soldiers in advance, who\\nallowed themselves to be beaten in order to lure him on. Light-armed\\nmen then went out against him, and retreated in skirmish order. And\\nthus he fell into my ambush. Drums and kettledrums sounded together,\\nthe ring closed around them on all sides and the robber army suffered\\na grievous defeat. The dead lay about like hemp-stalks, but little\\nTschauna succeeded in breaking through the circle. I sent out the\\nlight horsemen after him, and they seized him before the tent of the\\nenemy\\'s commanding general. Hastily I sent word to the princess, and\\nshe reviewed the prisoners before the palace. All the people, high and\\nlow, streamed together, to acclaim her. Little Tschauna was about to\\nbe executed in the market place when a messenger came spurring up with\\na command from the princess\\'s father to pardon him. The princess did\\nnot dare to disobey. So he was dismissed to his home after he had\\nsworn to give up all thought of realizing his traitorous plans. I was\\nloaded with benefits as a reward for my victory. I was invested with\\nan estate with three thousand peasants, and was given a palace, horses\\nand wagons, all sorts of jewels, men-servants and women-servants,\\ngardens and forests, banners and suits of mail. And my subordinate\\nofficers, too, were duly rewarded. On the following day a banquet was\\nheld, and the princess herself filled a goblet, sent it to me by one\\nof her attendants, and said: \\'Widowed early in life, I opposed the\\nwishes of my stern father and fled to this spot. Here the infamous\\nTschauna harassed me and well-nigh put me to shame. Had not your\\nmaster\\'s great kindness and your own courage come to my assistance,\\nhard would have been my lot!\\' Then she began to thank me and her tears\\nof emotion flowed like a stream. I bowed and begged her to grant me\\nleave of absence, so that I might look after my family. I was given a\\nmonth\\'s leave and the following day she dismissed me with a splendid\\nretinue. Before the city a pavilion had been erected in which I drank\\nthe stirrup-cup. Then I rode away and when I arrived before our own\\ngate a thunder-peal crashed and I awoke.\"', 'am in\\nneed and ashamed. Since you are kind enough to ask I will tell you\\nall.

I complained to my\\nstep-parents, but they loved their son blindly and did nothing. And\\nwhen I grew insistent they both became angry, and I was sent out here\\nto herd sheep.\" When she had done, the woman burst into tears and lost\\nall control of herself. Then she continued: \"The Sea of Dungting is\\nfar from here; yet I know that you will have to pass it on your\\nhomeward journey.

To all his questions the\\nwarrior replied: \"Our master is pleased at this moment to talk with\\nthe priest of the sun up on the coral-tower about the sacred book of\\nthe fire.

I\\ncould not bear to see her trouble and spoke to her. She complained\\nthat her husband had cast her out and wept bitterly. Then she gave me\\na letter for you. And that is why I have come to visit you, O King!\"', 'picked out a worthless husband\\nfor her. Instead of securing her happiness I have brought her to shame\\nin a distant land. You are a stranger and yet you have been willing to\\nhelp her in her distress, for which I am very grateful to you.\" Then\\nhe once more began to sob, and all those about him shed tears.\\nThereupon the monarch gave the letter to a servant who took it into\\nthe interior of the palace; and soon the sound of loud lamentations\\nrose from the inner rooms.', 'am afraid that Tsian Tang may hear\\nthem.\"', 'asked: \"Why should the matter be kept from him?\"', 'fear he\\nwould cause great damage.

Then the\\nking of heaven grew angry with him, and gave him to me to guard. I had\\nto chain him to a column in my palace.\"', 'fell to earth in terror.

A throng of maidens in\\nrosy garments received her, laughing and giggling, and led her into\\nthe interior of the palace. The king, however, presented Liu I to the\\nyouth and said: \"This is Tsian Tang, my brother!\"', 'have fought against the accursed dragons\\nand have utterly defeated them!\"', 'ate him alive!\"', 'was feasted at the castle. Music and dancing lent\\ncharm to the banquet. A thousand warriors with banners and spears in\\ntheir hands stood at attention. Trombones and trumpets resounded, and\\ndrums and kettledrums thundered and rattled as the warriors danced a\\nwar-dance. The music expressed how Tsian Tang had broken through the\\nranks of the enemy, and the hair of the guest who listened to it rose\\non his head in terror. Then, again, there was heard the music of\\nstrings, flutes and little golden bells. A thousand maidens in\\ncrimson and green silk danced around. The return of the princess was\\nalso told in tones. The music sounded like a song of sadness and\\nplaining, and all who heard it were moved to tears. The King of the\\nSea of Dungting was filled with joy. He raised his goblet and drank\\nto the health of his guest, and all sorrow departed from them. Both\\nrulers thanked Liu I in verses, and Liu I answered them in a rimed\\ntoast. The crowd of courtiers in the palace-hall applauded. Then the\\nKing of the Sea of Dungting drew forth a blue cloud-casket in which\\nwas the horn of a rhinoceros, which divides the water.

Which way shall I teach you?\" Said Sun Wu Kung: \"Whichever you\\nwill, O Master!\" Then the Master asked: \"Shall I teach you the way of\\nmagic?\" Said Sun Wu Kung: \"What does magic teach one?\" The Master\\nreplied: \"It teaches one to raise up spirits, to question oracles, and\\nto foretell fortune and misfortune.\" \"Can one secure eternal life by\\nmeans of it?\" inquired Sun Wu Kung. \"No,\" was the answer. \"Then I will\\nnot learn it.\" \"Shall I teach you the sciences?\" \"What are the\\nsciences?\" \"They are the nine schools of the three faiths. You learn\\nhow to read the holy books, pronounce incantations, commune with the\\ngods, and call the saints to you.\" \"Can one gain eternal life by means\\nof them?\" \"No.\" \"Then I will not learn them.\" \"The way of repose is a\\nvery good way.\" \"What is the way of repose?\" \"It teaches how to live\\nwithout nourishment, how to remain quiescent in silent purity, and sit\\nlost in meditation.\" \"Can one gain eternal life in this way?\" \"No.\"\\n\"Then I will not learn it.\" \"The way of deeds is also a good way.\"\\n\"What does that teach?\" \"It teaches one to equalize the vital powers,\\nto practise bodily exercise, to prepare the elixir of life and to hold\\none\\'s breath.\" \"Will it give one eternal life?\" \"Not so.\" \"Then I will\\nnot learn it! I will not learn it!\" Thereupon the Master pretended to\\nbe angry, leaped down from his stand, took his cane and scolded: \"What\\nan ape! This he will not learn, and that he will not learn! What are\\nyou waiting to learn, then?\" With that he gave him three blows across\\nthe head, retired to his inner chamber, and closed the great door\\nafter him.', 'was to be ready at the third\\nwatch of the night. His withdrawing to his inner chamber and closing\\nthe great door after him, meant that I was to go in to him by the back\\ndoor, and that he would make clear the great truth to me in secret.\"\\nAccordingly he waited until evening, and made a pretense of lying down\\nto sleep with the other disciples. But when the third watch of the\\nnight had come he rose softly and crept to the back door. Sure enough\\nit stood ajar. He slipped in and stepped before the Master\\'s bed. The\\nMaster was sleeping with his face turned toward the wall, and the ape\\ndid not venture to wake him, but knelt down in front of the bed. After\\na time the Master turned around and hummed a stanza to himself:', 'am waiting here reverentially!\"', 'was\\nto come to you at the third watch of the night, by the back door, in\\norder to be instructed in the truth. Therefore I have ventured to\\ncome. If you will teach me in the fulness of your grace, I will be\\neternally grateful to you.\"', 'will speak freely with you.\\nCome quite close to me, and then I will show you the way to eternal\\nlife.\"', 'call that crawling around on the\\nclouds, not floating on them, as do the gods and saints who fly over\\nthe whole world in a single day. I will teach you the magic\\nincantation for turning somersaults on the clouds. If you turn one of\\nthose somersaults you advance eighteen thousand miles at a clip.\"', 'bear you no ill will, but you must go away.\"', 'go?\"', 'will fetch your soul and lock it up in the nethermost hell, so that\\nyou cannot escape for a thousand eternities.\"', 'will not say a word! I will not say a word!\"', 'am back\\nagain, children!\" And at once, from the valley, from behind the rocks,\\nout of the grass and from amid the trees came his apes. They came\\nrunning up by thousands, surrounded and greeted him, and inquired as\\nto his adventures. Sun Wu Kung said: \"I have now found the way to\\neternal life, and need fear Death the Ancient no longer.\" Then all the\\napes were overjoyed, and competed with each other in bringing flowers\\nand fruits, peaches and wine, to welcome him. And again they honored\\nSun Wu Kung as the Handsome Ape King.', 'will see to him!\" With that he turned a\\nsomersault and disappeared without a trace.', 'am not too small for you; and I can make myself large at\\nwill. You scorn me because I am without a weapon, but my two fists can\\nthresh to the very skies.\" With that he stooped, clenched his fists\\nand began to give the devil a beating. The devil was large and clumsy,\\nbut Sun Wu Kung leaped about nimbly. He struck him between the ribs\\nand between the wind and his blows fell ever more fast and furious. In\\nhis despair the devil raised his great knife and aimed a blow at Sun\\nWu Kung\\'s head. But the latter avoided the blow, and fell back on his\\nmagic powers of transformation. He pulled out a hair, put it in his\\nmouth, chewed it, spat it out into the air and said: \"Transform\\nyourself!\" And at once it turned into many hundreds of little apes who\\nbegan to attack the devil. Sun Wu Kung, be it said, had eighty-four\\nthousand hairs on his body, every single one of which he could\\ntransform. The little apes with their sharp eyes, leaped around with\\nthe greatest rapidity. They surrounded the Devil-King on all sides,\\ntore at his clothes, and pulled at his legs, until he finally measured\\nhis length on the ground. Then Sun Wu Kung stepped up, tore his knife\\nfrom his hand, and put an end to him. After that he entered the cave\\nand released his captive children, the apes. The transformed hairs he\\ndrew to him again, and making a fire, he burned the evil cave to the\\nground. Then he gathered up those he had released, and flew back with\\nthem like a storm-wind to his cavern on the Mountain of Flowers and\\nFruits, joyfully greeted by all the apes.', 'would rather make magic and take some.\" So he blew on the\\nground. Then a tremendous storm-wind arose which drove sand and stones\\nbefore it, and caused all the soldiers in the city to run away in\\nterror. Then Sun Wu Kung went to the armory, pulled out one of his\\nhairs, turned it into thousands of little apes, cleared out the whole\\nsupply of weapons, and flew back home on a cloud.', 'took from the Devil-King is too light, and no longer suits me.\\nWhat should be done?\"', 'cannot go.\"', 'am the Dragon-King\\'s nearest neighbor, and have come to visit him.\"\\nThe Triton took the message to the castle, and the Dragon-King of the\\nEastern Sea came out hastily to receive him. He bade him be seated and\\nserved him with tea.', 'have learned the hidden knowledge and gained the\\npowers of immortality. I have drilled my apes in the art of warfare in\\norder to protect our mountain; but I have no weapon I can use, and\\nhave therefore come to you to borrow one.\"', 'have a weapon, it is true, but as yet I have\\nno armor. Rather than hunt up two or three other households, I think\\nyou will be willing to provide me with a suit of mail.\"', 'will not leave until you have obtained one for\\nme.\" And once more he began to swing his rod.', 'will ask my\\nbrothers.\"', 'have long since escaped from his power,\\nand how dare he have me dragged here!\" The more he reflected the\\nwilder he grew. He drew out the golden rod from his ear, swung it and\\nlet it grow large. Then he crushed the two constables to mush, burst\\nhis fetters, and rolled his bar before him into the city. The ten\\nPrinces of the Dead were frightened, bowed before him and asked: \"Who\\nare you?\"', 'am the heaven-born saint Sun\\nWu Kung of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruits. And now, who are you?\\nTell me your names quickly or I will strike you!\"', 'will suffer no impertinences from you!\"', 'was\\ndragged to Death\\'s castle and I caused considerable uproar there. I\\nhad them give me the Book of Life, and I struck out the mortal hour of\\nall the apes!\" And after that time the apes on the Mountain no longer\\ndied, because their names had been stricken out in the Nether World.', 'am the Evening Star of the Western\\nSkies, and I spoke for you. Therefore he has commissioned me to take\\nyou to the skies, so that you may be given a charge there.\"', 'had just been thinking I\\nought to pay Heaven a visit some time, and sure enough, Old Star, here\\nyou have come to fetch me!\"', 'am going up to the heavens\\nto look around there a little!\"', 'am the Venerable Sun!\"', 'was a\\nking, I was a father! What need was there for him to lure me into his\\nheaven to feed horses? I\\'ll do it no longer! I\\'ll do it no longer!\"', 'did not spend more than about ten days in\\nHeaven. This Lord of the Heavens does not know how to treat his\\npeople. He made me his stablemaster, and I had to feed his horses. I\\nam so ashamed that I am ready to die. But I did not put up with it,\\nand now I am here once more!\"', 'am Prince\\nNotscha, and have been ordered to take you prisoner!\" And with that he\\nswung his sword in the direction of Sun Wu Kung.', 'will stand here and never move.\"', 'will change shape, too!\"', 'cannot get the better of him!\" There was nothing left to\\ndo but to return to the Heavens and admit their overthrow. The Lord of\\nthe Heavens bowed his head, and tried to think of some other hero whom\\nhe might send out.', 'give you the charge of watching over them. Do your duty\\nconscientiously!\"', 'have been commanded by the\\nLord of the Heavens to tell all the gods and saints that they are\\nfirst to come to the Hall of Purity, in order to practise the rites,\\nand then go together to the Queen-Mother.\"', 'had\\nbetter go home first of all and sleep a bit.\" And he stumbled out of\\nthe garden with uncertain steps. Sure enough, he missed his way, and\\ncame to the dwelling of Laotzse. There he regained consciousness. He\\narranged his clothing and went in. There was no one to be seen in the\\nplace, for at the moment Laotzse was at the God of Light\\'s abode,\\ntalking to him, and with him were all his servants, listening. Since\\nhe found no one at home the Great Saint went as far as the inner\\nchamber, where Laotzse was in the habit of brewing the elixir of life.\\nBeside the stove stood five gourd containers full of the pills of life\\nwhich had already been rolled. Said the Great Saint: \"I had long since\\nintended to prepare a couple of these pills. So it suits me very well\\nto find them here.\" He poured out the contents of the gourds, and ate\\nup all the pills of life. Since he had now had enough to eat and\\ndrink he thought to himself: \"Bad, bad! The mischief I have done\\ncannot well be repaired. If they catch me my life will be in danger. I\\nthink I had better go down to earth again and remain a king!\" With\\nthat he made himself invisible, went out at the Western Gate of\\nHeaven, and returned to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruits, where he\\ntold his people who received him the story of his adventures.', 'can recommend a hero to you who will surely get the better of the ape.\\nIt is your grandson Yang Oerlang. He has conquered all the beast and\\nbird spirits, and overthrown the elves in the grass and the brush. He\\nknows what has to be done to get the better of such devils.\"', 'think I will have to go him one\\nbetter when it comes to changing shapes. It would be best for you to\\ntake away the sky-net so that our combat is not disturbed.\" Then he\\nrequested Li Dsing to post himself in the upper air with the magic\\nspirit mirror in his hand, so that when the ape made himself\\ninvisible, he might be found again by means of the mirror. When all\\nthis had been arranged, Yang Oerlang went out in front of the cave\\nwith his spirits to give battle.', 'am Yang Oerlang, the grandson of the Lord of the\\nHeavens!\"', 'remember! His daughter ran\\naway with a certain Sir Yang, to whom heaven gave a son. You must be\\nthat son!\"', 'can do that too!\"', 'will change my form as\\nwell in order to catch him.\" So he turned into a fish-hawk and floated\\nabove the surface of the water. When the ape in the water caught sight\\nof the fish-hawk, he saw that he was Yang Oerlang. He swiftly swung\\naround and fled, Yang Oerlang in pursuit. When the latter was no\\nfurther away than the length of a beak, the ape turned, crept ashore\\nas a water-snake and hid in the grass. Yang Oerlang, when he saw the\\nwater-snake creep from the water, turned into an eagle and spread his\\nclaws to seize the snake. But the water-snake sprang up and turned\\ninto the lowest of all birds, a speckled buzzard, and perched on the\\nsteep edge of a cliff. When Yang Oerlang saw that the ape had turned\\nhimself into so contemptible a creature as a buzzard, he would no\\nlonger play the game of changing form with him. He reappeared in his\\noriginal form, took up his crossbow and shot at the bird. The buzzard\\nslipped and fell down the side of the cliff. At its foot the ape\\nturned himself into the chapel of a field-god. He opened his mouth for\\na gate, his teeth became the two wings of the door, his tongue the\\nimage of the god, and his eyes the windows. His tail was the only\\nthing he did not know what to do with. So he let it stand up stiffly\\nbehind him in the shape of a flagpole. When Yang Oerlang reached the\\nfoot of the hill he saw the chapel, whose flagpole stood in the rear.\\nThen he laughed and said: \"That ape is really a devil of an ape! He\\nwants to lure me into the chapel in order to bite me. But I will not\\ngo in. First I will break his windows for him, and then I will stamp\\ndown the wings of his door!\" When the ape heard this he was much\\nfrightened. He made a bound like a tiger, and disappeared without a\\ntrace in the air. With a single somersault he reached Yang Oerlang\\'s\\nown temple. There he assumed Yang Oerlang\\'s own form and stepped in.\\nThe spirits who were on guard were unable to recognize him. They\\nreceived him on their knees. So the ape then seated himself on the\\ngod\\'s throne, and had the prayers which had come in submitted to him.', 'was vying with the ape in changing shape. Suddenly\\nI could no longer find him. Take a look in the mirror!\" Li Dsing took\\na look in the magic spirit mirror and then he laughed and said: \"The\\nape has turned himself into your likeness, is sitting in your temple\\nquite at home there, and making mischief.\" When Yang Oerlang heard\\nthis he took his three-tined spear, and hastened to his temple. The\\ndoor-spirits were frightened and said: \"But father came in only this\\nvery minute! How is it that another one comes now?\" Yang Oerlang,\\nwithout paying attention to them, entered the temple and aimed his\\nspear at Sun Wu Kung. The latter resumed his own shape, laughed and\\nsaid: \"Young sir, you must not be angry! The god of this place is now\\nSun Wu Kung.\" Without uttering a word Yang Oerlang assailed him. Sun\\nWu Kung took up his rod and returned the blows. Thus they crowded out\\nof the temple together, fighting, and wrapped in mists and clouds once\\nmore gained the Mountain of Flowers and Fruits.', 'will go with Laotzse to the\\nSouthern Gate of Heaven and see how matters stand.\" And when they saw\\nthat the struggle had still not come to an end she said to Laotzse:\\n\"How would it be if we helped Yang Oerlang a little? I will shut up\\nSun Wu Kung in my vase.\"', 'have a circlet of diamonds which can\\nenclose all living creatures. That we can use!\" So he flung his\\ncirclet through the air from the heavenly gate, and struck Sun Wu Kung\\non the head with it. Since he had his hands full fighting, the latter\\ncould not guard himself against it, and the blow on the forehead\\ncaused him to slip. Yet he rose again and tried to escape. But the\\nheavenly hound of Yang Oerlang bit his leg until he fell to the\\nground. Then Yang Oerlang and his followers came up and tied him with\\nthongs, and thrust a hook through his collar-bone so that he could no\\nlonger transform himself. And Laotzse took possession of his diamond\\ncirclet again, and returned with Guan Yin to the hall of Heaven. Sun\\nWu Kung was now brought in in triumph, and was condemned to be\\nbeheaded. He was then taken to the place of execution and bound to a\\npost. But all efforts to kill him by means of ax and sword, thunder\\nand lightning were vain. Nothing so much as hurt a hair on his head.', 'wish to speak with him!\" The\\ngods withdrew. Sun Wu Kung snorted and said: \"Who are you, who dare to\\nspeak to me?\" Buddha smiled and replied: \"I have come out of the\\nblessed West, Shakiamuni Amitofu. I have heard of the revolt you have\\nraised, and am come to tame you!\"', 'am the stone ape who has gained the hidden\\nknowledge. I am master of seventy-two transformations, and will live\\nas long as Heaven itself. What has the Lord of the Heavens\\naccomplished that entitles him to remain eternally on his throne? Let\\nhim make way for me, and I will be satisfied!\"', 'must ask you\\nwhether there is anything else you can do, aside from playing your\\ntricks of transformation?\"', 'can turn cloud somersaults. Each one carries me\\neighteen thousand miles ahead. Surely that is enough to entitle me to\\nbe the Lord of the Heavens?\"', 'will beg the\\nLord of the Heavens to make way for you. But if you are not able to\\nleave my hand, then you must yield yourself to my fetters.\"', 'help but leap\\nout of it?\" So he opened his mouth wide and said: \"Agreed!\"', 'will turn back and become Lord of\\nthe Heavens. But first I will write down my name to prove that I was\\nthere.\" He pulled out a hair, turned it into a brush, and wrote with\\ngreat letters on the middle column: \"The Great Saint Who Is Heaven\\'s\\nEqual.\" Then he turned his somersaults again until he had reached the\\nplace whence he had come. He leaped down from the Buddha\\'s hand\\nlaughing and cried: \"Now hurry, and see to it that the Lord of the\\nHeavens clears his heavenly castle for me! I have been at the end of\\nthe world and have left a sign there!\"', 'below.
