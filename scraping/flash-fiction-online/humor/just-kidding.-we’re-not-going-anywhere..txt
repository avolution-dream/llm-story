Title: JUST KIDDING. We’re Not Going Anywhere.

Let’s face it; sometimes you need a laugh. Alternatively, a reason to look a little sideways at life.

There are few genres more challenging to write than humor, but in this issue, our authors elevated short fiction funny to a whole new level. Their styles vary as much as their main characters, but one thing is sure. Squeeze this pocket-sized read into your busy day, and we promise it’ll get brighter.

From S. L. Saboviec, experience the strangest, most histrionic flower show this side of reality television in“How the 576th Annual Pollen Festival Blossomed My Budding Career.”

In“Strays”by Marion Deeds, a pair of shoes adopts a new owner. You don’t have to be a diehard fashionista to understand the pull of a fabulous set of heels. Sometimes empowerment comes from the strangest places.

Returning FFO author, Zach Shephard brings“The Black Clover Equation.”The perfect formulation for good luck has never gone so unluckily.

Moreover, in his FOURTH April FFO appearance, John Wiswell returns yet again, this time with a superhero reprint,“The Terrible.”Originally published in Daily Science Fiction, The Terrible is not Mercer. (Really. Stop calling him that.) Locked in his epic Bad-Guy struggle against Invulnerabella, The Terrible just wants to use his power-armor. Is that too much to ask?

Finally, a new installment ofFXXK WRITINGby Jason S. Ridler.Silence and Stupidity Part Iexplores how punk rock saved his life…and taught him to succeed both at writing and life.

And since we’re NOT going anywhere, why not celebrate by helping us help another terrific publication that isn’t going anywhere —Apex Magazine? Check out our contribution to theirRevive the Driveefforts.
