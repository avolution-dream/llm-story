tadthederailer, 1 year ago: Seriously? No way this is Graalnak. He doesn’t even answer questions in his own press conferences.

verbosiraptor, 1 year ago:The rules are clear: prove you’re Graalnak or we’ll delete this thread.

graalnak, 1 year ago:YOUR RULES DO NOT APPLY TO ME.

verbosiraptor, 1 year ago:It’s right there on the sidebar. No exceptions.

dishslinger, 1 year ago:Last week four Vroons came into the restaurant where I work. They had a five-course dinner: radish rosettes, radishpacho, radish salad, sauteed liver and radish leaves, radish sorbet for dessert. The bill came to $197.28. They left $200. That’s a $2.72 tip. It should have been at least $40. Can you please tell your people to start tipping appropriately?

graalnak, 1 year ago:TIPPING IS OPTIONAL. YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR THE $2.72.

ordinaryhuman, 1 year ago:Graalnak is correct no one gives me extra money just for doing my job.

tadthederailer, 1 year ago:Wait, is that $197.28 including tax? A standard tip used to be 15% on the pre-tax amount. Now you want 20% on everything?

burner2600, 1 year ago:Do interns get the schematics for those plasma weapon factories?

deliciouskoolaid, 1 year ago: How many Vroons does it take to change a lightbulb?

graalnak, 1 year ago:NONE. OUR TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED FAR BEYOND THE NEED FOR LIGHT BULBS.

dishslinger, 1 year ago:None, they’ll just make some human do it for substandard wages.

burner2600, 1 year ago:One to set the lightbulb-changing quotas and a thousand to punish every human who comes up short.

ordinaryhuman, 1 year ago:None, I will just sit on this pile of radishes in the dark.

deliciouskoolaid, 1 year ago: Is it true that Vroon ships visited the Earth 150 years ago?



burner2600, 1 year ago:Oh, not this again.

tadthederailer, 1 year ago:Not what again?burner2600, 1 year ago:Just a stupid urban legend.

deliciouskoolaid, 1 year ago:There are newspaper clippings from all over the world. A typical article describes “a large and bellicose individual with skin resembling the peel of a lime and an astonishing number of teeth” visiting farmers and insulting them. The details vary, but they’re all pretty similar.

ordinaryhuman, 1 year ago:That sounds like one of us.ordinaryhuman, 1 year ago:I mean them. One of them.

graalnak, 1 year ago:YOU ARE NOT FOOLING ANYONE, KLEEPTOR.

burner2600, 1 year ago:The way the story goes, the visitor would order the farmer to bring him his best radish. Then he’d take a bite, spit it out, and leave.

ordinaryhuman, 1 year ago:No Vroon would spit out a radish.deliciouskoolaid, 1 year ago:The reports all say he complained they weren’t radish-y enough. Something about tasting like sawdust compared to Dalgoxean hyper-radishes.

graalnak, 1 year ago:HYPER-RADISHES? I DEMAND YOU TELL ME THE LOCATION OF THESE HYPER-RADISHES IMMEDIATELY.

deliciouskoolaid, 1 year ago:They were from Dalgox-5, or Daglox-5, or something. I think it’s a planet.

graalnak, 1 year ago:TALGOX-5?

deliciouskoolaid, 1 year ago:Maybe.
