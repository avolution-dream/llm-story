We were present the following morning at the examination of Jack Renauld. Short
as the time had been, I was shocked at the change that had taken place in the
young prisoner. His cheeks had fallen in, there were deep black circles round
his eyes, and he looked haggard and distraught, as one who had wooed sleep in
vain for several nights. He betrayed no emotion at seeing us.

The prisoner and his counsel, Maître Grosíer, were accommodated with chairs. A
formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the door. The patientgreffiersat at his desk. The examination began.

“Renauld,” began the magistrate, “do you deny that you were
in Merlinville on the night of the crime?”

Jack did not reply at once, then he said with a hesitancy of manner which was
piteous:

“I—I—told you that I was in Cherbourg.”

Maître Grosíer frowned and sighed. I realized at once that Jack Renauld was
obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished, to the despair of his
legal representative.

The magistrate turned sharply.

“Send in the station witnesses.”

In a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom I recognized as being a
porter at Merlinville station.

“You were on duty on the night of June 7th?”

“Yes, monsieur.”

“You witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train?”

“Yes, monsieur.”

“Look at the prisoner. Do you recognize him as having been one of the
passengers to alight?”

“Yes, Monsieur le juge.”

“There is no possibility of your being mistaken?”

“No, monsieur. I knew M. Jack Renauld well.”

“Nor of your being mistaken as to the date?”

“No, monsieur. Because it was the following morning, June 8th, that we
heard of the murder.”

Another railway official was brought in, and confirmed the first one’s
evidence. The magistrate looked at Jack Renauld.
