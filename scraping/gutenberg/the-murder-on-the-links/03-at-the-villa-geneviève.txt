In a moment Poirot had leapt from the car, his eyes blazing with excitement. He
caught the man by the shoulder.

“What is that you say? Murdered? When? How?”

Thesergent de villedrew himself up.

“I cannot answer any questions, monsieur.”

“True. I comprehend.” Poirot reflected for a minute. “The
Commissary of Police, he is without doubt within?”

“Yes, monsieur.”

Poirot took out a card, and scribbled a few words on it.

“Voilà!Will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent
in to the commissary at once?”

The man took it and, turning his head over his shoulder, whistled. In a few
seconds a comrade joined him and was handed Poirot’s message. There was a
wait of some minutes, and then a short stout man with a huge moustache came
bustling down to the gate. Thesergent de villesaluted and stood aside.

“My dear M. Poirot,” cried the new-comer, “I am delighted to
see you. Your arrival is most opportune.”

Poirot’s face had lighted up.

“M. Bex! This is indeed a pleasure.” He turned to me. “This
is an English friend of mine, Captain Hastings—M. Lucien Bex.”

The commissary and I bowed to each other ceremoniously, then M. Bex turned once
more to Poirot.

“Mon vieux, I have not seen you since 1909, that time in Ostend. I
heard that you had left the Force?”

“So I have. I run a private business in London.”

“And you say you have information to give which may assist us?”

“Possibly you know it already. You were aware that I had been sent
for?”

“No. By whom?”

“The dead man. It seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his
life. Unfortunately he sent for me too late.”

“Sacri tonnerre!” ejaculated the Frenchman. “So he
foresaw his own murder? That upsets our theories considerably! But come
inside.”
