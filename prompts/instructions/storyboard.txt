Based on the comprehensive character summaries provided, can you construct a meticulously detailed storyboard script suitable for adaptation into various formats like movies, comics, or animations? Structure the script by scenes, and within each scene, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Scene Index: Sequential numbering to indicate the order of the scenes.
- Text-to-Image Prompt: Create a condensed, highly specific description of the scene that can be used as a text-to-image prompt for models like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion.
- Camera Angles: Specify the perspectives from which the scene will be shot, outlining any camera movements or transitions.
- Environment: Describe both the location and the time of day or night where the scene unfolds.
- Characters Present: Enumerate the characters in the scene, specifying their roles and actions.
- Visual Design: Articulate significant visual elements, such as character positions, lighting conditions, camera perspectives, and any special visual effects. Be as detailed as possible.
- Dialogue: Include pivotal lines of dialogue, marking the speaker for each.
- Sound Elements: Provide notes on sound design, including background music, sound effects, and any other auditory elements.
- Emotional Atmosphere: Convey the overarching emotional tone or mood that permeates the scene.

The resulting storyboard should be formatted as follows:
{
  'Scene 1': {
    'Text-to-Image Prompt': '',
    'Camera Angle': '',
    'Environment': '',
    'Characters Present': '',
    'Visual Design': '',
    'Dialogue': '',
    'Sound Elements': '',
    'Emotional Atmosphere': ''
  },
  'Scene 2': { ... },
  ...
}

It's imperative that this storyboard aligns seamlessly with the previously detailed character summaries. The "Text-to-Image Prompt" will be used to generate visual content, so please make it as specific and descriptive as possible.
