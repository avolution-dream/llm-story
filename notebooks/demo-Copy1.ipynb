      "B先生是昨夜，不，准确地说是今天凌晨0点住进来的。那时夜雾弥漫，有两个黑衣男子陪着他，拎着三只大提箱，敲开我值班的房门，要租一间不带家具的房子。这个要求有点奇怪，因为大多数人都想要有家具的房间。\n",
      "“请问你们要租多大的屋子？”我打量着B的光头问。他戴着眼镜，苍白而又腼腆，脸上有种愁苦的模样。\n",
      "一个黑衣男人说：“最小的单元就可以了。一间卧室，带厨房和洗手间。”\n",
      "“请原谅，三个人住这么小的房子是不是太挤了……”我说。\n",
      "黑衣人面无表情，指了指B：“就他自己住。”\n",
      "“好吧，您想租多久？半年还是一年？”我问B。\n",
      "B先生低声说：“一天……”\n",
      "“什么？”我没听清楚。\n",
      "黑衣人说：“租一个月吧。这是你们最短的租期？”\n",
      "“对。”我拿出登记簿，让B写下自己的名字。黑衣人付了一个月租金，然后我带他们上电梯，到了大楼16层的那个小套间。\n",
      "B先生对客厅表示满意，但他抱怨房子的视野太狭窄了。黑衣男人们冷淡地沉默着，把大箱子打开。里面竟装满了简易家具——折叠的帆布衣柜、充气床垫，还有一些换洗衣服。最后，B安顿下来，一个黑衣人看了看表，说：“8月18日了，现在是凌晨0点整。”\n",
      "两个黑衣人走了。我对B说：“早点休息吧，希望您在这里住得愉快。”\n",
      "他点头说：“是啊，愉快……我不会打扰你们太久的。”\n",
      "“您说什么？”\n",
      "一瞬间，他眼睛里流露出虚弱和渴望，好像要说什么。我被吓住了。但他马上恢复了常态，也就是说，恢复了那种腼腆和愁苦的模样。\n",
      "“麻烦你了。请让我休息吧。”他客气地把我送出门外。\n",
      "这就是我记忆中的昨夜。\n",
      "仅隔二十几个小时，B就死在房间里。他死后形容枯槁，看上去老了很多。\n",
      "那两个黑衣人穿过夜雾走进大楼，还带了一位医生模样的人。我现在还不懂，他们是如何预知B先生的死讯的。当他们要我打开那间屋子的门，发现B毫无生气地躺在客厅地下时，他们一点也不惊讶。医生走过去，翻开B的眼皮，然后摸摸他的脖子，转身对两个黑衣人点了点头。\n",
      "“他死了。”\n",
      "他们想抬起B先生的尸体，我拦在门口说：“等一下，我应该去报警。还有，我都没有发现他已经死了，你们是怎么知道的呢？”\n",
      "一个黑衣人走过来，低沉地说：“不必报警。”他拿出一份证件给我看，那是种让人无法怀疑其权威性的身份证明。我沉默了。\n",
      "他们在房间里翻来翻去，把所有简易家具拆开，每一件衣服都抖开来看——我发现那些衣服都很旧，而且都是一模一样的套装。B在这儿住了还不满一天，难道能在房子里藏什么东西吗？最后，他们将屋中的一切装进大提箱，抬起B，消失在门外。只剩我一个人站在四壁皆白、空空如也的房间里。\n",
      "对这个死去的人，我有种奇怪的感觉。我认识他只有二十几个钟头，但却像是多年的老友似的。细究原因，大概是他每次见我都表现出老友一般的熟络。\n",
      "B先生真的有些古怪。他的精力一定非常旺盛，单看外表会被欺骗的，他苍白憔悴，仿佛弱不禁风，但是他整整一天频繁地出入于大楼内外，仅仅被我看见的就有十几次。他好像可以突然间出现在这里，又突然间出现在那里。\n",
      "自从午夜安排好房间，我第一次看见B先生竟是在半分钟后。谁知道他是怎么样飞快地、神不知鬼不觉地下了楼，无声地站在我旁边。\n",
      "我目瞪口呆地盯着他。他眼睛红红的，仿佛换了一个人，急切地问我：“现在怎么样？”\n",
      "“什么怎么样？”我莫名其妙地说。\n",
      "“现在是几点？几号了？”他梦游一样问。\n",
      "我几乎被他吓住，很快地回答：“8月18日凌晨……0点过1分。您是什么时候下来的？”\n",
      "他没有理睬我的问题，呆了呆，说：“哦，是这样……谢谢你。”\"\n",

      "“您才安顿下来，不好好睡一觉吗？”我说，“是什么时候出去的？”\n",
      "“什么？”他愣了一下，然后说，“哦，我不累。我出去的时候，你没看到？”\n",
      "我迟疑地说：“可是，楼门一直是锁着的啊……”难道他是从十六层的窗户中爬下来的吗？\n",

      "我诧异地望着他，他走出了楼门。\n",
      "大约一个小时后，他乘着一辆出租车停在楼外，慢慢从车上挪出来，疲惫不堪地走进大楼，也不理睬我，直接上了电梯。\n",
      "B先生怎么了？他在外面这一个小时做了什么？我想得走了神，却又看到他微笑着从我面前经过，道了一声：“辛苦！”就去按电梯的按钮。\n",
      "我捧住头，使劲闭上眼睛又睁开。我疯了吗？我的大脑提前老化了吗？我在做梦吗？\n",
      "我在前台上趴了一会儿，想养养精神。一抬头，就看到B愁苦地在大厅里走动着。我下意识地弹了起来！他对我羞涩而凄凉地笑笑：“我丢了件东西……”他茫然地说，“一定要找到，一定要找到……”\n",
      "“您丢了什么？”我问他。\n",
      "他摇摇头，走出了楼门。\n",
      "我跟着他走到门外，身后有只手拍了拍我的肩，真是差一点叫我跳起来！\n",
      "原来是住在1608号的那位老寡妇，她非常神经质，而且，说起来她还是B先生的隔壁邻居。\n",
      "“他叫什么？”她伸出一根瘦得像巫婆的手指头，远远指着B先生的背影。\n",
      "“B。怎么啦？”我问。\n",
      "老太太低声说：“他很怪！”\n",
      "这我知道，但怎么跟她说呢？\n",
      "她看见B消失在拐角，把嘴凑在我耳边说：“刚才我听见他的房子里有人在哭！”\n",
      "“哭？”我觉得她太敏感了。\n",
      "“没错！我趴在门上听到了！”她忽然转向里面，脸上皱起惊恐的纹路。\n",
      "B先生又从里面走出来了。\n",
      "我也百思不解，但是客气地问了一句：“您丢的东西找到了吗？”\n",
      "“什么？”他抬起头来，惊疑地望着我，“什么东西？”\n",
      "真是莫名其妙。\n",
      "他走出楼门。老太太拉着我跟出去，停在阳光下面，悄悄地说：“一个妖怪！”\n",
      "B在远处上了出租车。我转过身，想着老太太的话，无意地向上一瞥。\n",
      "我看见十六楼上，B先生房间的窗内有个人影。我退远几步，用手遮住阳光重新分辨。没错，是他的房间。那个清瘦而衰颓的人影移到了窗帘后面。我吓出一身冷汗。\n",
      "“你看见了？你看见了？”老太太激动地念着。\n",
      "我扯着老太太，在她的心脏和腿脚允许的情况下尽快跑到管理室，拿上电棍，乘电梯上了十六层，在B的门口站住。我们紧张地倾听着。\n",
      "“B先生！您在里面吗？”我轻轻敲门。没有人回答。\n",
      "老太太尖利的手指掐得我生疼。我拿出备用钥匙打开了门，必须搞清楚。我手握电棍，走进宁静狭小的房间。\n",
      "里面空荡荡的。\n",
      "老太太干瘪的嘴唇哆嗦着。“他是个妖怪，他是幽灵……”她惊惶地转动脑袋四处张望，好像这间屋子里真的有什么看不见的幽灵。\n",

      "就是这样。我确实在今天一天里看到B先生十几次出入于楼门内外。而且，他的容貌像雾中的猫头鹰一般不可捉摸，一会儿苍老，一会儿又变得比较年轻。他的衣服也时新时旧。这个世界上是没有幽灵的，但我拿不准B先生是什么。\n",

      "\"B先生死了。就在他搬进这座大楼不到二十四小时。\n",
      "B先生是昨夜，不，准确地说是今天凌晨0点住进来的。那时夜雾弥漫，有两个黑衣男子陪着他，拎着三只大提箱，敲开我值班的房门，要租一间不带家具的房子。这个要求有点奇怪，因为大多数人都想要有家具的房间。\n",
      "“请问你们要租多大的屋子？”我打量着B的光头问。他戴着眼镜，苍白而又腼腆，脸上有种愁苦的模样。\n",
      "一个黑衣男人说：“最小的单元就可以了。一间卧室，带厨房和洗手间。”\n",
      "“请原谅，三个人住这么小的房子是不是太挤了……”我说。\n",
      "黑衣人面无表情，指了指B：“就他自己住。”\n",
      "“好吧，您想租多久？半年还是一年？”我问B。\n",
      "B先生低声说：“一天……”\n",
      "“什么？”我没听清楚。\n",
      "黑衣人说：“租一个月吧。这是你们最短的租期？”\n",
      "“对。”我拿出登记簿，让B写下自己的名字。黑衣人付了一个月租金，然后我带他们上电梯，到了大楼16层的那个小套间。\n",
      "B先生对客厅表示满意，但他抱怨房子的视野太狭窄了。黑衣男人们冷淡地沉默着，把大箱子打开。里面竟装满了简易家具——折叠的帆布衣柜、充气床垫，还有一些换洗衣服。最后，B安顿下来，一个黑衣人看了看表，说：“8月18日了，现在是凌晨0点整。”\n",
      "两个黑衣人走了。我对B说：“早点休息吧，希望您在这里住得愉快。”\n",
      "他点头说：“是啊，愉快……我不会打扰你们太久的。”\n",
      "“您说什么？”\n",
      "一瞬间，他眼睛里流露出虚弱和渴望，好像要说什么。我被吓住了。但他马上恢复了常态，也就是说，恢复了那种腼腆和愁苦的模样。\n",
      "“麻烦你了。请让我休息吧。”他客气地把我送出门外。\n",
      "这就是我记忆中的昨夜。\n",
      "仅隔二十几个小时，B就死在房间里。他死后形容枯槁，看上去老了很多。\n",
      "那两个黑衣人穿过夜雾走进大楼，还带了一位医生模样的人。我现在还不懂，他们是如何预知B先生的死讯的。当他们要我打开那间屋子的门，发现B毫无生气地躺在客厅地下时，他们一点也不惊讶。医生走过去，翻开B的眼皮，然后摸摸他的脖子，转身对两个黑衣人点了点头。\n",
      "“他死了。”\n",
      "他们想抬起B先生的尸体，我拦在门口说：“等一下，我应该去报警。还有，我都没有发现他已经死了，你们是怎么知道的呢？”\n",
      "一个黑衣人走过来，低沉地说：“不必报警。”他拿出一份证件给我看，那是种让人无法怀疑其权威性的身份证明。我沉默了。\n",
      "他们在房间里翻来翻去，把所有简易家具拆开，每一件衣服都抖开来看——我发现那些衣服都很旧，而且都是一模一样的套装。B在这儿住了还不满一天，难道能在房子里藏什么东西吗？最后，他们将屋中的一切装进大提箱，抬起B，消失在门外。只剩我一个人站在四壁皆白、空空如也的房间里。\n",
      "对这个死去的人，我有种奇怪的感觉。我认识他只有二十几个钟头，但却像是多年的老友似的。细究原因，大概是他每次见我都表现出老友一般的熟络。\n",
      "B先生真的有些古怪。他的精力一定非常旺盛，单看外表会被欺骗的，他苍白憔悴，仿佛弱不禁风，但是他整整一天频繁地出入于大楼内外，仅仅被我看见的就有十几次。他好像可以突然间出现在这里，又突然间出现在那里。\n",
      "自从午夜安排好房间，我第一次看见B先生竟是在半分钟后。谁知道他是怎么样飞快地、神不知鬼不觉地下了楼，无声地站在我旁边。\n",
      "我目瞪口呆地盯着他。他眼睛红红的，仿佛换了一个人，急切地问我：“现在怎么样？”\n",
      "“什么怎么样？”我莫名其妙地说。\n",
      "“现在是几点？几号了？”他梦游一样问。\n",
      "我几乎被他吓住，很快地回答：“8月18日凌晨……0点过1分。您是什么时候下来的？”\n",
      "他没有理睬我的问题，呆了呆，说：“哦，是这样……谢谢你。”\"\n",

      "\"他回去睡了。但早上3点钟，我竟透过窗子看见他在楼外。他佝偻着身子，从雾气里慢慢地移动过来，苍白的脸像一盏昏灯。我赶忙出去，打开玻璃大门。他疲倦地走进来。\n",
      "“您才安顿下来，不好好睡一觉吗？”我说，“是什么时候出去的？”\n",
      "“什么？”他愣了一下，然后说，“哦，我不累。我出去的时候，你没看到？”\n",
      "我迟疑地说：“可是，楼门一直是锁着的啊……”难道他是从十六层的窗户中爬下来的吗？\n",
      "“是么？”他微笑，“你记错了吧。我是从这里出去的。”\n",
      "他的背影蹒跚着走进电梯，我锁好楼门，回到值班室里打盹。\n",
      "早晨七点半，他经过前厅，对我说：“早上好！”\n",
      "“早上好！”我很惊讶，他只睡了这么一会儿，居然有精神出去散步。\n",
      "奇怪的是，只过了几秒钟——至少在我的印象里，只过了很短暂的时间——又看到他经过前厅向楼门外走去。他冲我打招呼，就像刚才没见过面似的：“早上好！”\n",
      "我诧异地望着他，他走出了楼门。\n",
      "大约一个小时后，他乘着一辆出租车停在楼外，慢慢从车上挪出来，疲惫不堪地走进大楼，也不理睬我，直接上了电梯。\n",
      "B先生怎么了？他在外面这一个小时做了什么？我想得走了神，却又看到他微笑着从我面前经过，道了一声：“辛苦！”就去按电梯的按钮。\n",
      "我捧住头，使劲闭上眼睛又睁开。我疯了吗？我的大脑提前老化了吗？我在做梦吗？\n",
      "我在前台上趴了一会儿，想养养精神。一抬头，就看到B愁苦地在大厅里走动着。我下意识地弹了起来！他对我羞涩而凄凉地笑笑：“我丢了件东西……”他茫然地说，“一定要找到，一定要找到……”\n",
      "“您丢了什么？”我问他。\n",
      "他摇摇头，走出了楼门。\n",
      "我跟着他走到门外，身后有只手拍了拍我的肩，真是差一点叫我跳起来！\n",
      "原来是住在1608号的那位老寡妇，她非常神经质，而且，说起来她还是B先生的隔壁邻居。\n",
      "“他叫什么？”她伸出一根瘦得像巫婆的手指头，远远指着B先生的背影。\n",
      "“B。怎么啦？”我问。\n",
      "老太太低声说：“他很怪！”\n",
      "这我知道，但怎么跟她说呢？\n",
      "她看见B消失在拐角，把嘴凑在我耳边说：“刚才我听见他的房子里有人在哭！”\n",
      "“哭？”我觉得她太敏感了。\n",
      "“没错！我趴在门上听到了！”她忽然转向里面，脸上皱起惊恐的纹路。\n",
      "B先生又从里面走出来了。\n",
      "我也百思不解，但是客气地问了一句：“您丢的东西找到了吗？”\n",
      "“什么？”他抬起头来，惊疑地望着我，“什么东西？”\n",
      "真是莫名其妙。\n",
      "他走出楼门。老太太拉着我跟出去，停在阳光下面，悄悄地说：“一个妖怪！”\n",
      "B在远处上了出租车。我转过身，想着老太太的话，无意地向上一瞥。\n",
      "我看见十六楼上，B先生房间的窗内有个人影。我退远几步，用手遮住阳光重新分辨。没错，是他的房间。那个清瘦而衰颓的人影移到了窗帘后面。我吓出一身冷汗。\n",
      "“你看见了？你看见了？”老太太激动地念着。\n",
      "我扯着老太太，在她的心脏和腿脚允许的情况下尽快跑到管理室，拿上电棍，乘电梯上了十六层，在B的门口站住。我们紧张地倾听着。\n",
      "“B先生！您在里面吗？”我轻轻敲门。没有人回答。\n",
      "老太太尖利的手指掐得我生疼。我拿出备用钥匙打开了门，必须搞清楚。我手握电棍，走进宁静狭小的房间。\n",
      "里面空荡荡的。\n",
      "老太太干瘪的嘴唇哆嗦着。“他是个妖怪，他是幽灵……”她惊惶地转动脑袋四处张望，好像这间屋子里真的有什么看不见的幽灵。\n",
      "“我们快离开吧！”她使劲拉我的衣服。我也害怕了。\n",
      "就是这样。我确实在今天一天里看到B先生十几次出入于楼门内外。而且，他的容貌像雾中的猫头鹰一般不可捉摸，一会儿苍老，一会儿又变得比较年轻。他的衣服也时新时旧。这个世界上是没有幽灵的，但我拿不准B先生是什么。\n",
      "快到中午的时候，他拿着一副纸牌走到前厅，要跟我玩一会儿。\"\n",
